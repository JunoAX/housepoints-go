# HousePoints Go Migration Roadmap

## Current Status (v0.4.0)

âœ… **Completed:**
- Multi-tenant database architecture (platform DB + family DBs)
- Subdomain-based routing (*.housepoints.ai)
- Connection pooling for family databases
- JWT authentication with login endpoint
- Password-based authentication (bcrypt)
- Authentication middleware
- Demo family setup for testing
- First protected endpoint (GET /api/chores)
- Production deployment infrastructure (Kubernetes/Flux)

ðŸŽ¯ **Currently Deployed:**
- Production: `demo.housepoints.ai` with JWT auth
- Staging: `staging.housepoints.ai` with JWT auth
- Legacy: `chores.gamull.com` (Python backend, untouched)

## Phase 1: Core API Development (Current Phase)

### 1.1 Essential Read Endpoints
Priority: **HIGH** | Estimated: 2-3 days

Build out read-only endpoints for core data:
- [ ] Users endpoints
  - `GET /api/users` - List all family users
  - `GET /api/users/:id` - Get user details
  - `GET /api/users/me` - Get current authenticated user
- [ ] Assignments endpoints
  - `GET /api/assignments` - List assignments (with filters: user, date range, status)
  - `GET /api/assignments/:id` - Get assignment details
- [ ] Points/Balance endpoints
  - `GET /api/users/:id/points` - Get user point balance
  - `GET /api/users/:id/history` - Get point history

**Why First:** These are the most frequently accessed endpoints and needed for mobile app read functionality.

### 1.2 Write Endpoints (Mutations)
Priority: **HIGH** | Estimated: 3-4 days

Add ability to modify data:
- [ ] Assignment mutations
  - `POST /api/assignments` - Create assignment (parents only)
  - `PATCH /api/assignments/:id` - Update assignment
  - `DELETE /api/assignments/:id` - Delete assignment (parents only)
  - `POST /api/assignments/:id/complete` - Mark as completed
  - `POST /api/assignments/:id/verify` - Verify completion (parents only)
- [ ] Chore mutations
  - `POST /api/chores` - Create chore (parents only)
  - `PATCH /api/chores/:id` - Update chore (parents only)
  - `DELETE /api/chores/:id` - Delete chore (parents only)

**Why Next:** Enables full CRUD operations for daily usage.

### 1.3 File Upload (Photo Verification)
Priority: **MEDIUM** | Estimated: 2 days

- [ ] Image upload endpoint for assignment verification
- [ ] S3/Object storage integration
- [ ] Image processing/thumbnails
- [ ] Cleanup old images

**Why:** Required for chores that need photo verification.

## Phase 2: User Management & Onboarding

### 2.1 Family Registration

**Why:** Needed to onboard new families beyond demo.

### 2.2 User Management
Priority: **MEDIUM** | Estimated: 2 days

- [ ] Add child users (parents only)

**Why:** First step to migrate real family.

### 3.2 Parallel Operation
Priority: **HIGH** | Estimated: 2-3 days

- [ ] Configure mobile app to use both endpoints
- [ ] Feature flag system (Go vs Python endpoints)
- [ ] Monitoring/logging for both systems
- [ ] Error tracking

**Why:** Allows gradual migration with rollback capability.

### 3.3 Full Migration
Priority: **HIGH** | Estimated: 1 week

- [ ] Migrate all Python endpoints to Go
- [ ] Data migration verification
- [ ] End-to-end testing with real usage
