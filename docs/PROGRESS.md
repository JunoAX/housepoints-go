4. [ ] Data validation and reconciliation
5. [ ] Python backend decommissioning

## Technical Decisions

### URL Strategy: Subdomain-based Routing ✅
**Decision**: Use family slugs as subdomains (e.g., `gamull.housepoints.ai`)

**Rationale**:
- Each family feels ownership of their subdomain
- Clean separation from API routes
- Natural isolation for theming/branding
- Scales well with wildcard SSL
- Easy to share: "Visit us at smith.housepoints.ai"

**Handling Duplicates**:
- First family: `smith.housepoints.ai`
- Subsequent: `smith-nyc.housepoints.ai`, `smith2.housepoints.ai`, etc.
- Families choose their slug during signup with validation

**Reserved Subdomains**: `api`, `www`, `app`, `admin`, `staging`, `dev`

### Architecture: Single Service Start → Microservices
**Current**: Monolithic Go service (0-500 families)
**Scale**: Horizontal pod autoscaling (500-5,000 families)
**Future**: Split to microservices (5,000-10,000 families)

### Database: PostgreSQL with Row-Level Security
**Strategy**: Multi-tenant with family_id isolation via RLS policies
**Connection**: pgxpool for connection pooling
**Migration**: Dual-write mode during transition

## Blockers & Issues

### Active Issues
- None currently

### Resolved Issues
1. ✅ Docker image architecture mismatch (ARM64 vs AMD64) - Fixed by adding `--platform=linux/amd64`
2. ✅ Flux not deploying manifests - Fixed by adding files to kustomization.yaml
3. ✅ Pods crashing with "exec format error" - Fixed by rebuilding for correct architecture

## Metrics & Goals

### Performance Targets
- **Response Time**: < 100ms for 95th percentile
- **Throughput**: 1,000 requests/second per pod
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability
- **Scale**: Support 10,000 families

### Cost Projections
- **Current**: $80/month (2 pods + staging)
- **At Scale** (10,000 families): $2,200/month
- **Savings vs Python**: 80% reduction (from $18k/month)

- **Status**: ✅ Copied and registered
- **Registration**: Family ID: 3f32f257-ad42-43d6-ae0a-8e4db9c1ce55

### Legacy Database (gamull_chores)
- **Location**: 10.1.10.20:5432
- **Purpose**: Python backend (chores.gamull.com)

## Next Session Priorities

### High Priority (Do First)
1. Implement database connection pooling with family routing
2. Update main.go to connect to platform database
3. Integrate family middleware into application
4. Add basic health check with database connectivity
5. Test end-to-end: subdomain → family lookup → family database connection

### Medium Priority
1. Build family signup API endpoint
2. Implement JWT authentication
3. Create user registration flow

### Low Priority
1. Set up monitoring dashboards
2. Write integration tests
3. Document API endpoints
