### In Progress Tasks

#### Database Layer (üöß In Progress)
- [ ] Create database migrations for multi-tenant schema
  - [ ] families table with slug, plan, active
  - [ ] family_settings table
  - [ ] family_members table (user-to-family relationships)
  - [ ] Add family_id columns to existing tables
  - [ ] Create RLS policies for tenant isolation
- [ ] Implement database connection pooling (pgxpool)
- [ ] Add database health checks
- [ ] Create migration runner

#### Core API (‚è≥ Not Started)
- [ ] Integrate family middleware into main.go
- [ ] Implement JWT authentication
- [ ] Create family signup/onboarding flow
- [ ] Add family-scoped API endpoints
- [ ] Build user management endpoints

### Upcoming Tasks (Prioritized)

#### Phase 2: Authentication & Core Features (Week 1-2)
1. [ ] Database connection and pooling
2. [ ] JWT authentication service
3. [ ] Family signup and onboarding API
4. [ ] User registration and login
5. [ ] Family member management
6. [ ] Session management

#### Phase 3: Business Logic Migration (Week 3-6)
1. [ ] Chores API endpoints
2. [ ] Points/rewards system
3. [ ] Assignments and scheduling
4. [ ] Notifications service
5. [ ] Reports and analytics

#### Phase 4: Testing & Optimization (Week 7-8)
1. [ ] Load testing with 100 concurrent users
2. [ ] Database query optimization
3. [ ] Caching strategy with Redis
4. [ ] Error handling and logging
5. [ ] Monitoring and alerts

#### Phase 5: Production Migration (Month 3)
1. [ ] Migrate Gamull family to Go backend
2. [ ] Parallel run with Python backend
3. [ ] Gradual traffic shift (10% ‚Üí 50% ‚Üí 100%)
4. [ ] Data validation and reconciliation
5. [ ] Python backend decommissioning

## Technical Decisions

### URL Strategy: Subdomain-based Routing ‚úÖ
**Decision**: Use family slugs as subdomains (e.g., `gamull.housepoints.ai`)

**Rationale**:
- Each family feels ownership of their subdomain
- Clean separation from API routes
- Natural isolation for theming/branding
- Scales well with wildcard SSL
- Easy to share: "Visit us at smith.housepoints.ai"

**Handling Duplicates**:
- First family: `smith.housepoints.ai`
- Subsequent: `smith-nyc.housepoints.ai`, `smith2.housepoints.ai`, etc.
- Families choose their slug during signup with validation

**Reserved Subdomains**: `api`, `www`, `app`, `admin`, `staging`, `dev`

### Architecture: Single Service Start ‚Üí Microservices
**Current**: Monolithic Go service (0-500 families)
**Scale**: Horizontal pod autoscaling (500-5,000 families)
**Future**: Split to microservices (5,000-10,000 families)

### Database: PostgreSQL with Row-Level Security
**Strategy**: Multi-tenant with family_id isolation via RLS policies
**Connection**: pgxpool for connection pooling
**Migration**: Dual-write mode during transition

## Blockers & Issues

### Active Issues
- None currently

### Resolved Issues
1. ‚úÖ Docker image architecture mismatch (ARM64 vs AMD64) - Fixed by adding `--platform=linux/amd64`
2. ‚úÖ Flux not deploying manifests - Fixed by adding files to kustomization.yaml
3. ‚úÖ Pods crashing with "exec format error" - Fixed by rebuilding for correct architecture

## Metrics & Goals

### Performance Targets
- **Response Time**: < 100ms for 95th percentile
- **Throughput**: 1,000 requests/second per pod
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability
- **Scale**: Support 10,000 families

### Cost Projections
- **Current**: $80/month (2 pods + staging)
- **At Scale** (10,000 families): $2,200/month
- **Savings vs Python**: 80% reduction (from $18k/month)
